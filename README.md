# 👋 Hi, I'm Patrick Egan

I’m a technical leader passionate about enabling high-performing teams and evolving engineering organizations. With deep experience in platform engineering, CI/CD, and cloud (AWS), I’ve built engineering effectiveness groups and led transformations that dramatically reduce lead time and increase team joy.

- ⚙️ Technical Principal & Delivery Lead
- 🧠 Creator of immersive dojo experiences for engineering enablement
- 🚀 Led teams from 5 to 100+ engineers across product and platform domains
- 🏗️ Architected systems that scale — from cash-based Java solutions at Target to org-wide DevOps transformations
- 🧾 Patent-holder driving $2–3B+ annual revenue
- 🔍 Focused on clear delivery, coaching, and long-term impact

I’m currently exploring Sr. Engineering Manager and Director roles where I can deepen impact, build trust, and help shape the next era of engineering culture.

Let’s build something impactful together.
